pip install anaconda, then

conda install:
    django
    mysql-connector-python
    mysqlclient

pip install
    django-jinja
    django-debug-toolbar


*********** In following I actually had to *hide* the mysql/lib directory *******
if necessary, make symbolic link (or maybe copy) /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib to /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib

possibly add usr/local/mysql/bin to $PATH

mv /usr/local/mysql/lib /usr/local/mysql/lib2
